## Sudoku Solver - A Java Solution to the Classic Puzzle

## Description
An app that solves Sudoku puzzles using a brute-force approach, with a GUI built using the Java Swing library.

## About
I created this project during my first year of college in 2021. I developed it after learning to solve mazes using DFS. I figured I could use the same approach to solve a Sudoku puzzle. The project seems simple by my standards today, but I still appreciate it as it was a significant achievement for me back then. It was before ChatGPT, so coding this was a real challenge for a beginner.

## To Compile
To compile the Java files, use the following command:
```
javac -d out .\src\*.java
```

## To Run
Once the project is compiled, run the game with the following command:
```
java -cp out SudokuSolverMain
```

## Features
- User-friendly GUI using Java's Swing library for easy input of a puzzle to solve.
- Brute-force approach produces interesting results: some puzzles solve easily, while others take a long time.
